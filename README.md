## Bio

Hello World!
 
My name is Eduardo and I'm a developer 💻. I've been working with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 🐍 for the last 8 years, most of the time working as a backend developer with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) but I also have some experience with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). I have some experience with Linux 🐧, Docker 🐳, Redis 🟥, RabbitMQ 🐰, and Celery 🌿.

In my freetime, I develop many things, one is a telegram bot 🤖: https://github.com/eduzen/bot. You can talk to him following this link: https://t.me/eduzen_bot.

Besides computers, I like good music, books, philosophy and lately mechanical keyboards (right now using a Leopold 75 %)!
