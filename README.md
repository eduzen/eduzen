### Bio

Hello World! My name is Eduardo and I'm a developer 💻. I've been working with Python 🐍 for the last 8 years, most of the time working as a backend developer with Django but I also have some experience with Flask. I have some experience with Linux 🐧, Docker 🐳, Redis 🟥, RabbitMQ 🐰, and Celery 🌿.

 I develop a telegram bot 🤖: https://github.com/eduzen/bot. You can talk to him following this link: https://t.me/eduzen_bot.

Besides computers, I like good music, books, philosophy and lately mechanical keyboards (right now using a Leopold 75 %)! I have a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Buenos Aires.
